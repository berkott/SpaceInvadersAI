# SpaceInvadersAI
This project is aimed at creating a Space Invaders AI. There is both an implementation through Neruo Evolution and using Policy Gradients found in the various folders of the project. 
Enjoy!

## Implementations
- Genetic Algorithm
- Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning
 
## Results
- With both algorithms above human average scores were recived

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by Google Deep Mind and their work with Deep Reinforcement Learning to play atari games.

## Software Used
- Keras
- Python3
- OpenAI Gym
- Numpy
- Pandas
